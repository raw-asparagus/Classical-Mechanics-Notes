    Results from applying physical ``laws" to particular situations
    \begin{dasheditemize}
        \item must be independent of the choice of coordinate system
        \item must be independent of the exact choice of origin for the coordinates
    \end{dasheditemize}
    $\implies$ Physical phenomena can be discussed through vector methods
    \blankline
    A vector -- quantity that can be represented as a directed line segment
